  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Konstantinos Gavriilidis is an Artificial Intelligence Engineer and researcher specialising in explainable AI, generative AI, and autonomous systems. He recently completed a PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at Heriot-Watt University, where his research focused on explainable reasoning for remote autonomous agents and transparent decision-making in mission-critical environments.</p>
  <p>His work bridges advanced AI research with real-world deployment. He has designed and evaluated large language model-based systems for human-agent interaction, developed surrogate model frameworks to interpret autonomous behaviour, and built robust evaluation pipelines to improve performance, reliability, and operator trust.</p>
