Konstantinos Gavriilidis is an Artificial Intelligence Engineer and researcher specialising in explainable AI, generative AI, and autonomous systems. He recently completed a PhD in Robotics and Autonomous Systems at Heriot-Watt University, where his research focused on explainable reasoning for remote autonomous agents and transparent decision-making in mission-critical environments.

His work bridges advanced AI research with real-world deployment. He has designed and evaluated large language model-based systems for human-agent interaction, developed surrogate model frameworks to interpret autonomous behaviour, and built robust evaluation pipelines to improve performance, reliability, and operator trust. His expertise spans NLP, AI agents, model evaluation, and responsible AI practices, alongside hands-on experience in scalable MLOps and cloud-based deployment.

Alongside his doctoral research, Konstantinos has collaborated extensively with industry. At SeeByte Ltd, he worked on explainability for maritime autonomous systems and automated reporting tools that significantly reduced analyst workload. As an AI Engineer at MedAscend, he contributes to the development and evaluation of virtual agent platforms for medical staff training. Earlier in his career, he worked as a Machine Learning Engineer at SnapDragon Monitoring, integrating deep learning models into production systems for large-scale classification and counterfeit detection, and as a Software Developer Intern building tools to streamline Docker-based deployments.

Across academia and industry, his focus remains consistent: building AI systems that are not only high-performing, but transparent, reliable, and deployable in complex real-world settings.
